REV_04 is the active product baseline. Child-facing and active product terminology SHALL use Hide & Seek exploration language only.

Historical product names, detective/police/arrest metaphors and related child-facing concepts are not active product authority.

## 1. PRODUCT ROLE — HARD LOCK

Hide & Seek is the connected island's vocabulary discovery and retrieval specialist.

Child-facing experience:
`WORD DISCOVERED → WORD HIDES → CLUE → SEEK → FIND → SPEAK/USE → HIDES AGAIN → SEEK AGAIN → STABLE MEMORY`

Core fantasy:
- words hide like treasure,
- the learner explores and finds them,
- the Guide accompanies the learner,
- missed words hide again and are found again,
- success means retrieval, not arrest/capture.

Do not expose educational jargon or legacy product names as the primary child-facing concept.

## 2. WORLD / BRAND CONTRACT — HARD LOCK

Active world language:
- 보물찾기
- 술래잡기
- 숨은 단어
- 단어 탐험
- 길 / Trail
- 단서 / Clue
- 찾기 / Seek
- 발견 / Find
- 다시 찾기 / Seek Again
- 길잡이 / Guide

Possible hiding environments may include forest, beach, cave, ruins, underground spaces, secret boxes, trees, rocks, maps, paths and other original island locations.

Forbidden as active child-facing world language:
- 경찰
- 형사
- 수사
- 체포
- 검거
- 범인
- 사건
- 사건 파일
- 단어 체포
- police/detective/arrest/case framing

World styling must remain original and must not imitate a copyrighted commercial game world.

## 3. NAME / LINEAGE CONTRACT

The active product name is **Hide & Seek**.

Any prior name may survive only in migration compatibility, repository history or archival evidence. It SHALL NOT appear as the normal installed-app name, primary UI title, onboarding identity, active project card or current master terminology.

`CURRENT PRODUCT NAME = HIDE & SEEK`
`LEGACY NAME ≠ CURRENT UI`
`LEGACY NAME ≠ CURRENT MASTER LANGUAGE`

## 4. PRESERVE LEARNING CORE

Preserve reliable source intake and vocabulary learning functions, including:
- camera/photo vocabulary-list intake,
- trustworthy word/meaning pairing,
- review-before-commit for uncertain OCR,
- bidirectional retrieval,
- speaking/TTS where supported,
- repeated recall of missed/weak words,
- multiple worksheet/list sets and separate/combined statistics where useful.

World changes must not reduce capture/OCR reliability.

## 4.1 SHARED ASSIGNMENT / RAPID CAPTURE INHERITANCE — HARD LOCK

When Hide & Seek renders or calls the shared GUIDE assignment/camera intake, it inherits:

`SHUTTER → IMMEDIATE TEMP SAVE → NEXT SHOT`

`ANALYZE ≠ END CAPTURE`
`BATCH ANALYZED ≠ SESSION CLOSED`

A targeted retake SHALL preserve unaffected valid photos/results and reprocess only affected evidence where safe.

Hide & Seek continues to own vocabulary-specific OCR/retrieval semantics; it does not absorb MAIN assignment authority.

## 4.2 OCR REVIEW PROVENANCE — HARD LOCK

`OCR DRAFT ≠ CONFIRMED WORD SET`

A low-confidence / `needsReview` item SHALL NOT become confirmed solely because a batch commit action occurred.
Confirmation requires a valid explicit resolution state such as user correction, user acceptance, or project-approved deterministic evidence.

## 5. SEEKING FLOW — ACTIVE CHILD-FACING MODEL

Preferred child-facing progression:

`FIRST FIND → MEANING CLUE → CONNECTION TRAIL → HIDDEN WORDS → FINAL SEEK → SEEK AGAIN`

Semantics:
- FIRST FIND = initial word exposure/acquisition
- MEANING CLUE = bidirectional meaning check
- CONNECTION TRAIL = word↔meaning association
- HIDDEN WORDS = weak/missed-word priority practice
- FINAL SEEK = final spelling retrieval challenge
- SEEK AGAIN = relearn then re-retrieve unstable words

Internal legacy implementation identifiers may remain temporarily for migration safety, but they are not product terminology.

Examples of migration-only identifiers:
- `codeRed`
- `caseMastery`
- legacy storage keys

`LEGACY INTERNAL KEY ≠ CHILD-FACING COPY`
`LEGACY INTERNAL KEY ≠ ACTIVE PRODUCT LANGUAGE`

## 6. PROGRESS TERMINOLOGY

Preferred user-facing progress terminology:
- **Trail Mastery** = current worksheet/list readiness
- **Memory Strength** = longer-term retention

Do not present police/case terminology as the learner's progress model.

`TRAIL MASTERY ≠ MEMORY STRENGTH`

## 7. CONNECTED SESSION CONTRACT

When called from Ready & Set:
- inherit `session_id / goal_id / task_id / lap_id / return_target`,
- app switch does not pause/reset the shared timer,
- app switch does not end the current Lap,
- Hide & Seek owns vocabulary-task results only,
- return `COMPLETED / PARTIAL / BLOCKED / HELP_NEEDED` as task-level state,
- never close the full Ready & Set session.

## 8. SNAP & POP HANDOFF

A found word may become expression material for Snap & Pop.

Example:
`FIND WORD → SPEAK WORD → SEND WORD/CONTEXT TO SNAP & POP → CHILD MAKES SENTENCE OR SPEAKS → RESULT RETURNS TO SHARED LEARNING HISTORY`

Do not create a duplicate independent long-term vocabulary registry inside Snap & Pop.

## 9. GUIDE

Use the shared Guide persona and connection concept.

Guide may give a minimal clue or short support, but must not reveal every answer immediately.

Clue use is a learning event, not a punishment.

Preferred Guide voice:
- 탐험 친구
- 길잡이
- 단서를 건네는 동료

Do not use police/detective-partner framing.

## 10. IMAGINATION CLOUD

Hide & Seek may call the shared Imagination Cloud when a word's meaning, context or image association would materially help retrieval.

Rules:
- child question may trigger it,
- visual/context support must explain rather than decorate,
- do not replace retrieval effort with answer display,
- preserve session/task/lap,
- return to the same vocabulary task.

## 11. REWARD IDENTITY

Hide & Seek may use found-word, hidden-word, treasure-map, trail, clue or treasure-style collection feedback.

Do not copy Snap & Pop's gem/wish/blessing economy wholesale.
Do not make reward accumulation more important than actual retrieval.

Historical/runtime reward mechanics such as XP, streak, level, calendar, themes, best record or achievements SHALL NOT be silently promoted to protected Hide & Seek identity or silently removed while current product authority remains unresolved.

## 12. DEVICE / RESPONSIVE CONTRACT — HARD LOCK

Phone:
- Portrait Only.

Tablet:
- Portrait + Landscape.

Tablet UI Scale Ceiling:
- landscape usable height.

Additional tablet width should expand World / Environment before inflating the core UI into an oversized phone-like surface.

`TEXT IS NEVER BAKED INTO IMAGE`
`BACKGROUND ≠ UI`
`SYSTEM FACT ≠ GUIDE VOICE`

Unintended overlap, excessive separation, clipping, broken alignment/anchoring or alternate-orientation composition failure = FAIL.

## 13. PWA SAFE AUTO-UPDATE — HARD LOCK

Inherit shared update strategy:
`GITHUB PUSH → HOST AUTO DEPLOY → AUTO VERSION DETECT → PREPARE UPDATE → APPLY AT SAFE POINT`

Never force reload during an active shared session or active vocabulary attempt.
Persist current sheet/list, word position, task/lap/session identifiers and committed results before activation.

## 14. APP NAME / ICON RELEASE GATE

Installed product identity SHALL be Hide & Seek.

At UI freeze:
- create an original ultra-high-density illustration master icon,
- derive required PWA/Apple touch icon sizes,
- update manifest `name`, `short_name`, icons and relevant title metadata,
- test Safari + iPhone Home Screen installation/update behavior,
- verify no legacy product naming or detective/police/arrest world language remains in the approved release.

## 15. MIGRATION / COMPATIBILITY

Do not break existing learner data solely to rename the product/world.

Allowed temporarily:
- legacy localStorage/IndexedDB key names,
- legacy internal state-property names,
- migration code that recognizes older versions.

These identifiers must be documented as compatibility-only and must not leak into ordinary UI copy.

When safe migration is implemented:
`READ LEGACY → NORMALIZE → WRITE CURRENT → VERIFY → RETAIN FALLBACK WINDOW → RETIRE LEGACY`

## 16. REGRESSION FAIL CONDITIONS

FAIL if:
- legacy product name appears as current child-facing brand,
- police/detective/arrest/case framing appears as active child-facing world language,
- old world terms are reintroduced by fallback/runtime normalization,
- OCR/capture safety is weakened for visual novelty,
- a low-confidence OCR item is silently promoted to confirmed without a valid resolution state,
- rapid shared capture inserts per-shot blocking confirmation/classification,
- analysis is treated as automatic capture-session termination,
- phone/tablet orientation behavior contradicts the device contract,
- app switch resets timer/session/lap,
- Hide & Seek completes the whole multi-task session,
- clues reveal answers by default,
- Imagination Cloud bypasses retrieval,
- vocabulary results become isolated from shared Learning History,
- app update interrupts active learning.

## 17. LATER TAKY PROMOTION NOTE

When the user explicitly authorizes central TAKY application, promote this project correction as:

`ZPD WORD CHILD-FACING IDENTITY → SUPERSEDED`
`POLICE / DETECTIVE / ARREST WORD WORLD → SUPERSEDED`
`HIDE & SEEK + TREASURE SEEK / TAG / HIDDEN WORD EXPLORATION → ACTIVE`

Do not infer central TAKY write authorization from this project-master update alone.

END — HIDE & SEEK UI MASTER LOGIC REV_04

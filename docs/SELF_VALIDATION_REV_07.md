# Hide & Seek — Self-Validation Report

Build status: **VALIDATED BUILD / WORLD-MIGRATION IN PROGRESS**
Release status: **NOT RELEASE PASS**
Current master: `Hide_Seek_UI_MASTER_LOGIC_REV_04.md`

## MASTER gate

- Active product name: Hide & Seek.
- Active world: treasure-seek / hide-and-seek / hidden-word exploration.
- Police/detective/arrest/case child-facing framing: superseded.
- Previous product/world terminology may remain only in migration compatibility or historical evidence.

## Static / package validation scope

Preserve and revalidate:
- manifest/asset parsing
- camera/library separation
- rapid capture and image preflight
- OCR SEE/PAIR
- Review-before-Commit
- FIRST FIND / MEANING CLUE / CONNECTION TRAIL / HIDDEN WORDS
- FINAL SEEK spelling retrieval
- SEEK AGAIN targeted re-retrieval
- Drag & Drop + Tap fallback
- wrong-key immediate rejection
- fake-key exclusion from required blank characters
- PASS/TIMEOUT/HINT result separation
- Trail Mastery / Memory separation
- safe areas / responsive rules
- session-only credentials where applicable
- export/import and legacy-state migration
- live-text policy
- photo-first Home

## WORLD regression scan

FAIL if visible current UI contains:
- ZPD Word as current brand,
- police / detective / arrest world framing,
- 경찰 / 형사 / 수사 / 사건 / 사건파일 / 체포 / 검거 / 범인,
- legacy case-file identity as the dominant user experience.

Internal compatibility identifiers are not a FAIL by themselves if they remain invisible and are explicitly migration-only.

## PENDING LIVE TEST

Cannot be marked PASS until deployed to a real HTTPS origin:
- Service Worker registration/activation
- cache population and cleanup
- offline relaunch
- update behavior after deployment
- installed PWA name/icon
- production asset paths
- visible world-language regression scan

## PENDING DEVICE TEST

Requires actual phone/device and/or authorized API environment:
- rear camera
- photo library
- real worksheet quality/orientation cases
- real OCR request and recovery
- iOS/Android home-screen install behavior
- touch Drag & Drop
- Hide & Seek naming/world consistency on installed PWA

## Verdict

The learning/capture core remains reusable, but `RELEASE PASS` requires live + device verification after the Hide & Seek world migration is fully reflected in runtime copy and installed metadata.
